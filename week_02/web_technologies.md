#Web Technologies in the WayBack Machine
The wayback machine seems to use pages that are html as well as css. 
I can see quite a few scripts that got loaded when the page loaded as well. 
The page also loaded some json data. When accessing the archives it looks like it loaded some more scripts and json data. Beyond that, it looks like the WayBack Machine uses wahtever languages the page it has archived.
